/**
 * This interface represent an Event Visitor object,
 * this is part of implementation for Observable Pattern
 * paired together with Visitor Patter, using the idea that
 * comes from: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6608600">stackoverflow</a>.
 *
 * This implementation is made for cases of many observables and many observers.
 *
 * The generalization is, if an object accept a visitor, then that object
 * is also an observable. If an object visit an acceptor, then that object
 * is also an observer.
 *
 * This implementantion also generalize the interactions, creating method that
 * allow to every class interact with every class, including interaction of
 * two same classes with different instanciation. At this time not all classes
 * interact with all other but in the future it is possible and it will be "easy"
 * to implement.
